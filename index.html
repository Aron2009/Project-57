    <h1> My Favorite Hobby
        Playing Soccer </h1>
    <p> My favorite hobby is playing soccer. It is a good sport for maintaining health, fitness, strength and endurance. Soccer helps build friendships, learn to win and accept loss, and teaches you about teamwork. It is fun and unique because sports dont usually have a rule where you can only use your feet. It feels nice to run around with your friends kicking a ball and passing between players.</p>
